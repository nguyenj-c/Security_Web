# Security_Web

Created as part of the course [ECUE5] entitled "Security Web". 
In each directory you can launch ```php -S localhost:5555 ``` to have the visual result of the programm.
So we have the directory called hash wich compare the different type of [hash function of PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.hash.php) by their time of execution and we also do the same with the directory called OpenSLL wich compare not the hash function but the encryption and decryption of password using [OpenSLL method](https://www.php.net/manual/fr/book.openssl.php).
After that, we have 2 others directory that are website to configure and find the errors in the code.
